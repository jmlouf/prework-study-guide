## Description

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used for referencing necessary skills that a coder can use to "build a house" in terms of programming. Each section includes helpful notes about certain topics, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Additionally, we can access the DevTools console to see the JavaScript running. It's purpose is to list all of the topics that we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
